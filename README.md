This challenge was a refactor challenge meaning that a starter code was given and edits were made to fit the grading criteria.

The most important edits included changing almost all of the <div></div> to their respective semantic elements.
An example of this was changing line 28 from <div></div> to <section></section>.

All of the edits that were made to the semantic elements of the html were almost made to match in the CSS file.
The lines of code in the CSS file with a "." in front of the line did not need to be changed due to them referencing specific classes and not the semantic elements.

Another edit that was made was adding the alt elements to the images that are linked in the files.
